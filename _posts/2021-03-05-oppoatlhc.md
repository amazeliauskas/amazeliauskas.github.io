Just five months after it [began]({% post_url 2020-12-27-my-first-organized-workshop %}), it is the wrap-up time for one of the most exciting scientific adventures of my career so far --- my first
organized physics workshop [Opportunities of OO and pO collisions at the LHC](http://cern.ch/OppOatLHC) or **OppOatLHC** for short.
Together with amazing co-organizers Jasmine Brewer and Wilke van der Schee, we embarked on a mission to bring the physics community
to discuss physics opportunities (and challenges) of doing oxygen ion collisions at the LHC.

The 5-day workshop took place Feb 4-10, 2021 (with a weekend break). During 27 invited talks and 8 discussion sessions we
covered a wide range of topics including technological, theoretical, and experimental aspects of **OppOatLHC**.
From my personal feeling, and the feedback received, it seemed to be a very successful workshop. We totaled nearly 400 registrations
and well over 100 connections per day to workshop talks. It was a great feeling that our workshop has attracted
a comparable amount of attention as a major conference in the field.

However, our work was not finished with the end of the talks, as just a few weeks later we were due to give
a workshop summary at [145th LHCC Open session](https://indico.cern.ch/event/998052/). [Large Hadron Collider Committee](https://scientific-info.cern/archives/history_CERN/Scientific_committees) (LHCC)
is a scientific committee dedicated to reviewing the progress and plans of the LHC program. I was honoured to represent my co-organizers and
advertise unique opportunities for oxygen collisions to this important scientific panel.
The accompanying summary document of the **OppOatLHC** workshop has now been made public on arXiv[^1].


The entire adventure was a great learning experience. Besides getting to organize a scientific event,
 I certainly became much more knowledgeable about the inner workings of CERN and LHC. 
It takes an incredible amount of coordination (and compromise) among many hundreds and even 
thousands of people for ideas on paper to become actual running plans in reality. As a theorist
working on, well, rather theoretical matters, it was very exciting to get a sense of making a Â (even if small) contribution
to bringing some of such ideas closer to becoming reality. Now, I just look forward to some **OppOatLHC**.
