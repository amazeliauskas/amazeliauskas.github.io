On the 9th of March over 30 Lithuanian scientists with interest in particle physics
gathered virtually for the first [Lithuanian Particle Physics Meeting](http://cern.ch/LPPM2021) (LPPM2021).
I was very happy to help organise this one day event, which brought together small, but growing
Lithuanian particle physics community. 

In the past, there has not been many high energy particle physics opportunities in Lithuania,
so not surprisingly many of the young participants have received their education abroad or 
are currently studying in various foreign universities. However, since 2018 Lithuania
has become an associated CERN member and the situation is changing. This prompted us to
try and establish a global Lithuanian particle physics network.

During short presentations 17 speakers presented their career path and current research field.
It was very exciting to hear Lithuanian scientists working in a diverse range of fields
from high energy experiments at CERN to muonic hydrogen in PSI, from B meson factory in Japan
to geo-neutrino experiments in Canada. There were also presentation by theoreticians
working on cosmology, mathematical physics and precision perturbative QCD calculations.

The day was wrapped up by a constructive discussion about particle physics outreach
in Lithuania and ways of contributing to further particle physics development in our homeland.
I think the meeting was a great success and I hope it will become a yearly tradition.
