title: Science outreach in Lithuania
---

During my long vacations in Lithuania, I decided to 
do some science outreach and I gave three presentations on my work at **CERN**.

First, on Saturday Jan 11th, I visited additional training physics school **Fizikos Olimpas** during its
January session week in Vilnius. In somewhat cold lecture room (heating presumably turned off on weekends), there
was a warm atmosphere and physics-oriented school-children from around the country listened
to my talk and asked pointed questions.

On Monday Jan 13th, I gave a talk at Vilnius University **Institute for Theoretical Physics and Astronomy**
upon kind invitation of local scientist [dr. Darius Jurčiukonis](http://www.tfai.vu.lt/index.php?siteaction=personnel.view&id=216&menu=about). I was a bit nervous giving my
first scientific talk in Lithuanian. The talk drew a sizable audience and interesting questions. I was also complimented
on my Lithuanian translations of technical jargon. However, in the future I will probably stick to English to make
my talk accessible to non-Lithuanian speakers working at or visiting Vilnius University.


Finally, on Wednesday Jan 15th I visited my former high-school **Gabija** in Mažeikiai. 
Here I was greeted by a large audience of 16-19 old school goers. Although a bit tired of loud talking
(decided against using a mic), I was happy to answer a variety of questions about CERN and my work as a scientist.
Afterwards, I was given a tour of school by deputy-head and my former physics teacher.
