title: Science outreach in Lithuania
---

During my long vacations in Lithuania, I decided to 
do some science outreach and gave three presentations on my work at **CERN**.

First, on Saturday, Jan 11th, I visited Additional Training Physics School **Fizikos Olimpas** during its
January session week in Vilnius. In a somewhat cold lecture room (the heating presumably turns off on weekends), there
was a warm atmosphere and physics-oriented schoolchildren from around the country listened
to my talk and asked pointed questions.

On Monday, Jan 13th, I gave a talk at Vilnius University **Institute for Theoretical Physics and Astronomy**
upon the kind invitation of local scientist [Dr. Darius Jurčiukonis](http://www.tfai.vu.lt/index.php?siteaction=personnel.view&id=216&menu=about). I was a bit nervous about giving my
first scientific talk in Lithuanian. The talk drew a sizable audience and interesting questions. I was also complimented
on my Lithuanian translations of technical jargon. However, in the future I will probably stick to English to make
my talk accessible to non-Lithuanian speakers working at or visiting Vilnius University.


Finally, on Wednesday, Jan 15th I visited my former high school **Gabija** in Mažeikiai. 
Here, I was greeted by a large audience of 16-19 old schoolgoers. Although a bit tired of loud talking
(>I decided against using a mic), I was happy to answer a variety of questions about CERN and my work as a scientist.
Afterward, I was given a tour of the school by the deputy head and my former physics teacher.
