One of the privileges of working at CERN is the opportunity to see the particle experiments up close.

On Wednesday, Feb 5th, a group of CERN theorists was given a private underground tour of the [ATLAS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/atlas) detector.
The above-the-ground building has a very colourful wall painting of the detector, which is actually done
at a smaller scale than the real thing. However, hundred meters below the ground it is hard to grasp the dimensions of this huge particle detector and my smartphone camera really does not do justice.
I was fascinated to be reminded again, that detectors like ATLAS can track microscopic particles
over distances of meters with a precision of micrometers.
