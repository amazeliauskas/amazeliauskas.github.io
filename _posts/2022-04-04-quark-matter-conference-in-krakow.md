title: Quark Matter conference in Krakow
---

From the 4th to the 10th of April, 2022 the [XXIX Quark Matter](https://qm2021.syskonf.pl/) conference took place
in Krakow, Poland. It was the first major conference for me and many of my colleagues
after the 2019 Quark Matter conference in the fateful Wuhan, China. 
Although it looked like the world was emerging from the pandemic restrictions,
many people were prevented from attending the conference due to the Russian invasion of
neighbouring Ukraine. Scientists with Russian affiliations were expelled from
participating at the conference, while some Western physicists were concerned about
going to Poland, which is hosting a large number of Ukrainian refugees.

Because I am Lithuanian Krakow for me is a very special city. As the ancient capital
of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, Krakow has many connections with Lithuanian history.
It is always been a pleasure for me to visit this beautiful city. I made sure to come a couple of days in advance to do more sightseeing.
Despite the looming war, I found the city unchanged, with the same majestic town square, gorgeous churches, and
throngs of tourists. The only notable change was the displayed messages of support for Ukraine.

I missed attending the in-person conference. Nowhere else, you can grab 2-3 physicists from
different institutions and have a quick spontaneous discussion. Also, seeing hundreds of
other heavy-ion physicists bring a sense of community, which is crucial
for moving forward as a field. There were many exciting talks 
and I was proud to present my own work or see it presented by my co-authors.
I was especially thrilled to see my friend and colleague Sören Schlichting being awarded [Zimányi medal](https://wigner.hu/en/zimanyi-medal) for 
> _For his groundbreaking work on turbulence in Yang-Mill
fluids and its implications for thermalization in heavy ion collisions, and his important
contribution to matching the nonequilibrium initial stage of heavy ion collisions to
hydrodynamics with QCD kinetic theory_.



Unfortunately, there were also some unpleasant incidents at the conference. A great many
of the conference participants became infected with COVID during or after the conference. After two years of successfully avoiding
the illness, I also tested positive a couple of days after the conference. Thanks to vaccines,
the symptoms were mild and I have since fully recovered. In another sort of incident,
one conference participant was expelled from the conference for breaking the
code of conduct. Bad as such things are, I can only hope that after this our immunity
to both COVID and improper behaviour will only grow stronger.
