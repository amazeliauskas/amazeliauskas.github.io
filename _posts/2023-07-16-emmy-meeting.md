I recently had the opportunity to participate in my first [Emmy Noether Meeting](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/programme/einzelfoerderung/emmy_noether/jahrestreffen/2023/index.html), which took place from July 7th to 9th. The Emmy Noether Meeting is an annual gathering of junior group leaders supported by the DFG Emmy Noether (EN) Programme. The event brought together approximately 140 scientists from various disciplines at a beautiful lake-side hotel in Potsdam, providing a platform for networking and knowledge exchange through a series of workshops.

I was thrilled to participate in this event as it allowed me to connect with peers who share the same position and face similar challenges. It can sometimes feel isolating to be a group leader, with others looking to you for guidance. However, at the Emmy Noether Meeting, we had the opportunity to share our experiences and receive valuable advice from more experienced EN fellows and alumni.
The program kicked off with scientific speed-dating sessions and subject-specific workshops. Given that Medicine, Physics, and Biology are the most common subjects among EN recipients, my subject group was quite sizable. Although I didn't come across any particle physicists, I did have engaging conversations with physicists working in other fields. The first day concluded with a thought-provoking panel discussion on the impact of artificial intelligence on science[^1].

The following two days were filled with a wide range of parallel workshops. Personally, I was particularly interested in sessions focusing on ERC grant applications and the intricacies of university professorship applications. Additionally, on Saturday evening, we had the unique opportunity to embark on a theatrical walk with Emmy Noether herself, which offered a glimpse into the life of the first female German mathematics professor. It was a truly memorable experience to meet Emmy Noether during the Emmy Noether Meeting!

Although my time in Potsdam seemed to pass by in a flash, I managed to carve out a few hours to explore the magnificent Sanssouci Park. I am immensely grateful to the DFG for organizing such a valuable event. They were exceptionally supportive, and I will not hesitate to turn to them for help in the future. While I undoubtedly gained a wealth of useful information during these days, the sense of belonging to a vibrant community was the most invaluable takeaway from my time in Potsdam. I eagerly look forward to my second year as an EN fellow and the upcoming EN meetings that lie ahead!
