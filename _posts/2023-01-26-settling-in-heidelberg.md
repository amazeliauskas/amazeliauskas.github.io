It has been nearly four months since my start at Heidelberg as an Emmy Noether Group leader. 
The transition has been smooth, and I feel almost completely settled in. I have successfully filled PhD and postdoc positions in my group.
My office is now furnished, and I have made it cosy with various decorations. The only outstanding issue is finding permanent accommodation, but anyone who tried searching in Heidelberg can attest it is not an easy task. :)

One of the privileges of Emmy Noether's position is being able to supervise PhD students. I am delighted that my PhD student [Fabian](/people) got off to a good start. He produced exciting results with QCD kinetic theory code in the first couple of months. He will present our work at his first major conference---[Hard Probes](https://wwuindico.uni-muenster.de/event/1409/)--in March. On the one hand, I am anxious about being the _senior_ person on the paper because it is up to me to guarantee the quality of this work. On the other hand, I genuinely enjoy sharing my experience and knowledge with younger colleagues.

In addition, I had to fill a postdoc position in my group. This task turned out to be more challenging than I expected.
On the positive side, I was overwhelmed by the number of excellent postdoc candidates applying with me. However, this presented me with the impossible problem of finding a unique ordering among several brilliant people with multi-dimensional experience and skills. The applicants are often faced with a similar situation of choosing the optimal career path.
In the end,  I am thrilled with the outcome of the search. Adam Takacs, currently a PhD student at [Konrad Tywoniuk's group](https://thermaljets.w.uib.no/team/) in Bergen, will join my group at the end of the summer.

The first few months at Heidelberg have been hectic. In addition to setting up my group, I co-organised the second edition of the [Quantum Systems in Extreme Conditions](https://indico.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/event/504/) conference. The QSEC brought experts from distant fields (from cold atoms to highly charged ions to heavy-ion collisions) to discuss the common universal phenomena in isolated quantum systems. These questions are at the core of the Collaborative Research Centre [ISOQUANT](https://www.isoquant-heidelberg.de).
I am pleased to join ISOQUANT again, this time as one of the Principal Investigators. I had a busy travel schedule with two trips to Paris, two trips to CERN and my first visit to Santiago de Compostela. This year is no different with a busy schedule of paper and proposal writing and travels planned nearly every month. On top of that, I will give lectures for the first time at [Heidelberg Graduate Physics Student Days](https://www.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/graddays/20231)!

I lived in Heidelberg before, so it was easy to fall back into the routine. However, I want to discover new things during my second stay here. First, I found a lovely pottery studio in the middle of the old town, where I can enjoy Saturday mornings at the throwing wheel. After a few years of watching chess online, I finally picked up the courage to visit the local chess club. One noticeable change in Germany since my last stay is the booming vegan market. I got intrigued and have been trying out vegan recipes!

In summary, I am happy to be back at Heidelberg and look forward to future adventures. :)
