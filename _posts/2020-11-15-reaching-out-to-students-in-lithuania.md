title: Reaching out to students in Lithuania
---

There are two pieces of news. First, I recently gave an interview about myself to 
Jonas Jurgaitis, the founder of the informal biology training school [ERUDITAS](http://eruditai.lt).
The interview can be found [here (in Lithuanian)](https://www.eruditai.lt/lietuvis-mokslininkas-nuo-mokyklos-laiku-as-nesitaiksciau-su-nezinojimu/).

Second, this September I took up some new responsibilities. I volunteered to be the leader of the physics section in the additional
training school [Nacionalinė Moksleivių Akademija](https://nmakademija.lt) (National Student Academy) in Lithuania. 
[NMA](https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacionalin%C4%97_moksleivi%C5%B3_akademija) is an extracurricular school for gifted high-school children in Lithuania. It is composed
of eight sections: biochemistry, chemistry, economics, physics, informatics, Lithuanian philology, mathematics, 
and music. Students with a particular interest in one of the subjects attend 5 and 10 day in-person winter
and summer sessions. During the sessions, schoolchildren take subject lessons with expert teachers, university professors, or students.
In addition, children have the chance to participate in a wide variety of personal development activities and evening events. During the periods between the sessions, pupils do distance-learning homework sets.
One of the NMA goals is to reduce the education disparity in Lithuania and give 
gifted children of all backgrounds access to expert subject training.


I have a strong personal connection with the NMA because during 2005-2007 I was myself a student there.
One of the pillars of NMA is a strong sense of community. For someone like me (coming from a non-academic background and not a major city in Lithuania) it was very important to meet other young people dedicated to their subject of interest. Many of them became my close friends and now I have a network of young professionals and academics rising in their careers. No less important was the chance to 
engage with university professors, superb teachers, and a large number of well-known public figures. I was very inspired by these famous and important people paying attention to us, schoolchildren.


Now, more than ten years after graduating from school, I find myself in the lucky position to be able to contribute back to the education in my home country. Currently, I am organizing the preparation of teaching material and homework problems for the students. Participation in physics competitions was a significant part of my physics training at school, but neat physics problems have little to do with my day-to-day research as a scientist. Therefore I hope to use my experience to inform school children about what recent physics problems scientists have solved (e.g. Higgs boson, black holes, Bose-Einstein condensate) and what puzzles are still waiting for their contribution (e.g. dark matter). I want to show them that the simple physics principles they study at school are the same tools used by scientists to solve the mysteries of the Universe.
