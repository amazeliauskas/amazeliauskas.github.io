I am a theoretical physicist working on **many-body phenomena** emerging from fundamental
interactions of elementary particles. 

In my research I connect models of **nuclear**, **hadronic**
and **particle physics** with methods of relativistic hydrodynamics, statistical physics and out-of-equilibrium dynamics to study the **hot and dense nuclear matter** created in high-energy hadron
collisions. My work has contributed to a better understanding of fundamental states of matter, thermalisation of isolated quantum systems, and how a fluid-like
behaviour emerges from a relatively small number of constituents interacting via the strong
force.

I work at [Institute for Theoretical Physics](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de) at **Heidelberg University**.
Previously, I was a senior research Fellow at [Theoretical Physics department](https://theory.cern/people) at **CERN**, Switzerland. My first postdoctoral position was at **Heidelberg University**, Germany.
I worked in the groups of [Prof. Dr. J&uuml;rgen Berges](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~berges) and  [Priv.-Doz. Dr. Stefan Fl&ouml;rchinger](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~floerchinger/) at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de) under the collaborative research project [SFB 1225 ISOQUANT](https://www.isoquant-heidelberg.de/).
Before that I was a PhD student at [Nuclear Theory Group](http://tonic.physics.sunysb.edu/ntg/Home.html) at **Stony Brook University**, US (PhD advisor [Prof. Dr. Derek Teaney](http://tonic.physics.sunysb.edu/~dteaney/)).
