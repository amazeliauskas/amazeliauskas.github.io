#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
#
#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
#
#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello, my name is Aleksas Mazeliauskas. I am a **theoretical physicist** working on **many-body phenomena** emerging from interactions of a small number of particles in **high-energy hadron collisions** and **ultracold quantum gases**.

Since 2022 I have been leading an **Emmy Noether Research Group** at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de) at **Heidelberg University**. As of 2024, I am a **project leader** at the Collaborative Research Center [ISOQUANT](https://www.isoquant-heidelberg.de/). 

My group's research focuses on the microscopic understanding of the **emergent collective phenomena** in systems of **varying sizes** and at **varying energy scales**. I am especially interested in the question of **thermalisation** and **hydrodynamic behaviour** in isolated quantum systems.

Check out my [research projects](/projects), [publications](/publications) and [profiles](/people) of my group members. See the [news announcements](/news) for open positions and [my blog](/blog) for occasional posts about my life as a researcher.
