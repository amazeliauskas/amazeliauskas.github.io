    I am fascinated by many-body physics emerging from interactions of elementary particles in a hot and dense nuclear matter created in high-energy hadron collisions at particle accelerators like LHC (CERN) and RHIC (BNL). I am trying to understand the properties of the new state of nuclear matterâ€”the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is formed at extreme temperature and density. Outside hadron collisions, such conditions can be found only at the beginning of the Universe and in violent neutron start mergers.

    Recently I have been particularly interested in the formation of the quark-gluon plasma at the earliest stages of the collision. I use a weakly coupled kinetic theory of quarks and gluons to perform state-of-the-art simulations elucidating the phenomena of equilibration and fluid-like behaviour of relatively small number of particles interacting via the strong force. I have also worked on the hydrodynamic descriptions of quark-gluon plasma expansion and I am actively working on improving the conversion from fluid fields to measurable hadrons at late stages of the collision.
