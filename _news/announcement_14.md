Several new paper by my group: [Bayesian Constraints on Pre-Equilibrium Jet Quenching
and Predictions for Oxygen Collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19430),  [Adiabatic hydrodynamization and quasinormal modes of nonthermal attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15016), [Minijet thermallization and jet transport coeffiecients in QCD kinetic theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25669) and [Deriving a parton shower for jet thermalization in QCD plasmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25837). Well done [Adam](/people) and [Fabian](/people)!
