This week I published two new papers: [Adiabatic hydrodynamization and quasinormal modes of nonthermal attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15016) and [Minijet thermallization and jet transport coeffiecients in QCD kinetic theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25669). The former in collaboration with [Fabian](/people) and [Adam](/people)
