For several years, I have been a strong advocate for the unique physics opportunities presented by light-ion collisions at the LHC. Witnessing these collisions take place was a deeply rewarding moment.</p> <p>More than <a href="/blog/2020/from-discussion-to-publication/">five years ago</a>, during my time as a CERN Fellow, we identified that the planned oxygen-oxygen (OO) collisions could provide an ideal testing ground for observing high-momentum energy loss signals in small systems—still an outstanding problem in the field. Following our publications <a class="citation" href="#Huss:2020whe">(Huss et al., 2021; Huss et al., 2021)</a>, I co-organized a workshop on <a href="http://cern.ch/OppOatLHC">the physics opportunities of proton-oxygen and oxygen-oxygen collisions</a> and presented the physics case to the LHC Committee. I went on to publish two more papers on observables in these systems <a class="citation" href="#Brewer:2021tyv">(Brewer et al., 2022; Gebhard et al., 2024)</a>. Over time, community support for a dedicated light-ion run solidified, and the collisions finally took place during the first week of July.</p> <p>Remarkably, the run also included a one-fill session of neon-neon collisions, enabling <a href="/blog/2024/light-ions/">comparative studies of nuclear shape effects between oxygen and neon</a>. This opportunistic addition became possible thanks to colleagues who made a strong physics case and to accelerator physicists who demonstrated that a rapid switch to neon was feasible.</p> <p>During the oxygen run, I was fortunate to receive private tours of both the CERN Control Centre (CCC) and the ALICE Control Room. It was my first time visiting the CCC in Prévessin, which oversees the entire CERN accelerator complex. The room is enormous—lined with hundreds of monitors controlling everything from injections to cryogenics. I was particularly impressed by the fast turnaround of particle beams in the PS and SPS accelerators, which supply proton and ion beams to a wide array of CERN experiments. Once the LHC is filled, it may take 8–12 hours before the next injection, during which time experiments across the complex—including in the North Area—are conducted.</p> <p>Though the LHC is CERN’s flagship machine, it’s important to remember that the infrastructure supports a broad range of scientific studies, from medical isotopes and cosmic ray physics to cloud formation and neutrino research.</p> <p>At the CCC, I learned more about how beams are accelerated and monitored. Lighter ions like oxygen bring unique challenges. If my theory-trained brain understood correctly, their lower mass makes it harder to keep the ions bunched due to stronger electric repulsion. Partially stripped oxygen ions are also more prone to colliding with residual gas in the beam pipe. These are non-trivial challenges that accelerator physicists must overcome to achieve high-luminosity beams.</p> <p>While I was at the CCC, the accelerator was running proton-oxygen (pO) collisions—important for cosmic-ray studies, with dedicated measurements taken by the LHCf detector near ATLAS. A large dataset was collected, which will also help calibrate the subsequent OO collisions.</p> <h2 id="a-night-at-alice">A Night at ALICE</h2> <p>On the evening of July 4th, I headed to the ALICE Control Room, anticipating the very first oxygen-oxygen collisions at the LHC. I got a firsthand glimpse of the patience and vigilance required from experimental physicists. A small in-person crew monitors detector performance, data quality, and safety protocols, backed by a larger group of on-call experts available around the clock. Crews rotate in 8-hour shifts to ensure non-stop data collection.</p> <p>The LHC, being the most complex machine in the world, requires strict safety protocols. Even small deviations trigger automatic beam dumps to protect both the machine and the experiments. I arrived around 8 p.m., but the first declaration of stable beams was delayed—first to 11 p.m., then to midnight.</p> <p>Finally, around 12:15 a.m., the first OO physics fill began. The beams are injected in stages, in bunches, over about 30 minutes. Then they must be accelerated from the injection energy (450 GeV) to the collision energy (5360 GeV), matching that of previous Pb-Pb collisions and, more importantly, the pp reference energy.</p> <p>Because the LHC’s physical ring is fixed, its magnetic field must increase with beam energy to maintain the particles’ circular path. However, just as the ramp-up phase began, the beam was lost. Something I hadn’t known: once ramping starts, the magnets must complete the entire cycle—even without the beam—ramping all the way up and back down. This ensures the magnets reach their full field strength safely.</p> <p>This procedure meant we had to wait another hour before a second beam fill. Fortunately, this time the ramp-up was successful, and at 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, the oxygen beams reached their target collision energy. We all waited for the official declaration of stable beams—the signal for detectors to switch from standby to active data collection mode.</p> <p>Unfortunately, another issue triggered a beam dump just before data taking could begin, restarting the cycle. At that point, I decided to get some rest, leaving the ALICE crew to handle the overnight shift. By 5 a.m., stable beams were finally achieved. I returned later in the morning, just to take a selfie with live OO collision events! I even received a special OO run t-shirt—a gesture I really appreciated. In the end, the OO run was a resounding success. All experiments collected far more data than the minimum requirement.</p> <h2 id="whats-next-neon-and-beyond">What’s Next: Neon and Beyond</h2> <p>I returned to Heidelberg that Saturday, but just a few days later, the LHC was filled with neon. Despite some technical hiccups, a long fill of neon-neon collisions was successfully carried out. The next phase is the data analysis frenzy: internal calibration, unfolding, estimating statistical and systematic uncertainties—all before any results are made public. This process can take anywhere from a few months to years, depending on the observable.</p> <p>However, we can expect the first preliminary results to be shared at the upcoming <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1479384/">Initial Stages conference in Taipei</a>, which I’m particularly excited about for two reasons. First, I’ve been invited to give a plenary talk on predictions and interpretations for OO and pO collisions—an incredible honor. Second, I’ve developed a baseline prediction for the nuclear modification factor of charged hadrons, under the null hypothesis that no QGP is formed in OO collisions. If experimentalists observe a statistically significant deviation from this baseline, we could claim the discovery of energy loss in systems with just ~10 participating nucleons on average—a potential breakthrough.</p> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2> <p>In summary, it has been an incredibly rewarding experience to be part of the collective effort that contributed to running the world’s most advanced scientific experiment. It’s deeply inspiring to be surrounded by curious minds, all motivated to push the frontiers of knowledge and overcome technical challenges. This spirit, as CERN proudly puts it, is accelerating science.</p> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/1.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/2.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/3.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/4.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/6.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/7.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/8.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/CERN2025/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="CERN"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[July 2-5, 2025, I made a short but memorable trip to CERN, where—for the first time in its history—the LHC collided oxygen ions.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Light ion workshop at CERN</title><link href="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2024/light-ions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Light ion workshop at CERN"/><published>2024-11-17T11:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-17T11:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2024/light-ions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2024/light-ions/"><![CDATA[<p>November 11-15, 2024, my group (Adam, Fabian, and Jannis) and I attended the <a href="https://cern.ch/lightions">CERN TH workshop on Light ion collisions</a>. It was a very exciting week of the latest predictions and perspectives of light ion collisions at the LHC. A couple of years ago, I co-organized a similar workshop on <a href="https://cern.ch/OppOatLHC">opportunities of oxygen-oxygen and proton-oxygen runs at the LHC</a>. According to the latest scheduling, the exciting 1-week program will take place in summer 2025. Just in time for the workshop, we published Jannis’s master’s work on no-quenching baseline calculations for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions <a class="citation" href="#Gebhard:2024flv">(Gebhard et al., 2024)</a>. We showed that nuclear parton distribution functions are one of the dominant limiting factors in ascertaining small energy loss signals. However, we showed that in some kinematic range the semi-inclusive observables jet-triggered hadron measurements can achieve a percent level of accuracy.</p> <p>Since the previous workshop, new physics opportunities with light ions have been discovered. In particular, comparisons of oxygen-oxygen and neon-neon collisions would test ab initio computations of nuclear structure. To put it simply, the ion collisions at the LHC can be used to make detailed images of nuclei. This new and exciting development is bringing together high-energy and low-energy nuclear physicists. We heard interesting talks about the latest first-principles computations of light ion nuclear structure. LHC accelerator complex is fully capable of delivering neon (and potentially other ion) beams, but no neon-neon collisions are currently planned in Run 3. However, it is important to be prepared since even a short opportunistic run neon-neon would bring qualitatively new knowledge.</p> <p>On a personal level, it was nice to meet many of my colleagues and friends. It was also a first time visit for my PhD students (Fabian and Jannis) at CERN. I hope they were inspired by the visit and keen on <em>accelerating science</em> (see group photo below).</p> <div class="row mt-3">     <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/emmyatCERN.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/emmyatCERN.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure>     </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="emmy"/><category term="CERN"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[November 11-15, 2024, I and my group (Adam, Fabian and Jannis) attended CERN TH workshop on Light ion collisions at the LHC.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First year of my Emmy Noether group</title><link href="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2023/group/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First year of my Emmy Noether group"/><published>2023-12-26T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-26T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2023/group</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2023/group/"><![CDATA[<p>As of October 2023, I have completed my first year (out of a maximum of six) as an <a href="/projects/light-ions/">Emmy Noether Research Group Leader</a> at the Institute for Theoretical Physics. Overall, it was a great and enjoyable year working with my group and other colleagues at Heidelberg University.</p> <h3 id="emmy-group">Emmy group</h3> <p>In spring, <a href="/people">Jannis</a> joined my group as a master student. In August <a href="/people">Adam</a> started his first postdoctoral position at the University of Heidelberg. With <a href="/people">Fabian</a> as a PhD student, now I only need a bachelor student to have the full academic ladder. The transition from spending most of the time working on research to mostly managing others doing research was surprisingly swift. However, I truly enjoy mentoring and teaching, so I like this new way of doing research. It is a great feeling to develop new research ideas in discussions with my group members.</p> <p>2023 has been a busy year all round. Fabian produced exciting results on mini-jet quenching, which he has already presented at multiple conferences: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01177">Hard Probes in Aschaffenburg</a>, Initial Stages in Copenhagen and Zimanyi School in Budapest. We are currently writing these results up as his first paper. Jannis has been progressing on baseline calculations of semi-inclusive observables for oxygen-oxygen collisions. He attended the MCnet Summer School in Durham and quickly became an expert on running MadGraph (next-to-leading-order Monte-Carlo event generator). Adam came to Heidelberg only recently, but we already started working on a joint project. Independently, he has just finished a great collaborative project on isolating perturbative QCD splittings in heavy-ion collisions, which he recently presented at the Quark Matter conference in Houston and a jet workshop at INT Seattle.</p> <p>During my first year in Heidelberg, I had a hectic travel schedule with at least one travel per month (see, for example, my post about <a href="/post/2023-07-16">Emmy Noether meeting in Potsdam</a>). Therefore, I promised myself not to travel in the last couple of months before Christmas. I wanted to spend more time with my group and settle into a routine in Heidelberg.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/conf/1.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/conf/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/conf/2.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/conf/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/conf/3.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/conf/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="berges-group">Berges group</h3> <p>As a newly established group, I am happy to benefit from close integration with <a href="https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~berges/people.htm">Prof. Jürgen Berges group</a>. We share the office space for students, run group seminars, and have group lunches. The bigger group makes it easier to have a lively group atmosphere.</p> <p>We also collaborate closely on various projects. One example is my recent paper with Michal Heller (Gent University) and Thimo Preis (Jürgen’s PhD student) on prescaling relaxation to nonthermal attractors <a class="citation" href="#Heller:2023mah">(Heller et al., 2024)</a>. Jürgen and I introduced this phenomenon during my postdoc time in Heidelberg.

CRC is a perfect place to start interdisciplinary collaborations, and I am very excited about a joint project between cold-atom and heavy-ion researchers. In addition, I have joined the equal opportunities team and have been supporting various Diversity, Equity and Inclusion activities at CRC.</p> <hr/> <p>In summary, 2023 was an excellent year for me and I look forward to 2024.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="emmy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of October 2023, I have completed my first year (out of a maximum of six) as an Emmy Noether Research Group Leader at the Institute for Theoretical Physics.

The Emmy Noether Meeting is an annual gathering of junior group leaders supported by the DFG Emmy Noether (EN) Programme. The event brought together approximately 140 scientists from various disciplines at a beautiful lake-side hotel in Potsdam, providing a platform for networking and knowledge exchange through a series of workshops.</p> <p>I was thrilled to participate in this event as it allowed me to connect with peers who share the same position and face similar challenges. It can sometimes feel isolating to be a group leader, with others looking to you for guidance. However, at the Emmy Noether Meeting, we had the opportunity to share our experiences and receive valuable advice from more experienced EN fellows and alumni. The program kicked off with scientific speed-dating sessions and subject-specific workshops. Given that Medicine, Physics, and Biology are the most common subjects among EN recipients, my subject group was quite sizable. Although I didn’t come across any particle physicists, I did have engaging conversations with physicists working in other fields. The first day concluded with a thought-provoking panel discussion on the impact of artificial intelligence on science<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p> <p>The following two days were filled with a wide range of parallel workshops. Personally, I was particularly interested in sessions focusing on ERC grant applications and the intricacies of university professorship applications. Additionally, on Saturday evening, we had the unique opportunity to embark on a theatrical walk with Emmy Noether herself, which offered a glimpse into the life of the first female German mathematics professor. It was a truly memorable experience to meet Emmy Noether during the Emmy Noether Meeting!</p> <p>Although my time in Potsdam seemed to pass by in a flash, I managed to carve out a few hours to explore the magnificent Sanssouci Park. I am immensely grateful to the DFG for organizing such a valuable event. They were exceptionally supportive, and I will not hesitate to turn to them for help in the future. While I undoubtedly gained a wealth of useful information during these days, the sense of belonging to a vibrant community was the most invaluable takeaway from my time in Potsdam. I eagerly look forward to my second year as an EN fellow and the upcoming EN meetings that lie ahead!</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>This blog post was edited with the help of Grammarly and ChatGPT. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="emmy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently had the opportunity to participate in my first Emmy Noether Meeting, which took place from July 7th to 9th.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Physics outreach in Heidelberg</title><link href="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2023/physics-outreach-in-heidelberg/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Physics outreach in Heidelberg"/><published>2023-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2023/physics-outreach-in-heidelberg</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2023/physics-outreach-in-heidelberg/"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of 2023, I was occupied with preparations for two significant events: the <a href="https://www.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/graddays/20231">50th Heidelberg Physics Graduate Days</a> and the <a href="https://www.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/girlsday/programm#start">Girls’ Day 2023</a>.</p> <p>At the end of 2022, I was asked to give a one-week course for physics PhD students before the start of the summer semester in April. As a new member of the Institute for Theoretical Physics, I was delighted with the opportunity to present my research to physics students. However, it was my first time giving a series of blackboard lectures, so I was pretty nervous. I chose to lecture on <em>Non-equilibrium phenomena and thermalization in Quantum Chromodynamics</em>. This is my research topic, and I have recently co-written a review <a class="citation" href="#Berges:2020fwq">(Berges et al., 2021)</a> about it. It was not easy (and I wasn’t wholly successful) to find intuitive explanations for a diverse audience of over 20 physics students, from cold-atom experimentalists to string theoreticians. My worry that I would run out of material during the ten-hour lecture course did not come true. However, there were several times when I felt I lost my audience, either because the topic was too complicated or because I was not confident in my explanations. Overall, I evaluate the whole experience as a success, and I look forward to future teaching opportunities.</p> <p><a href="https://www.girls-day.de">Girls’ Day</a> is the Germany-wide yearly event (on April 27th this year) where high-school girls can learn about traditionally male-dominated technical and natural science professions. Starting in 2001, Girls’ Day attracts around a hundred thousand students yearly. My Emmy Noether Grant includes funds for gender equality measures, and I was looking for ways to increase diversity in physics. I was invited by <a href="https://www.isoquant-heidelberg.de/team-member/tina-kuka/">Tina Kuka</a> to join the organization of Girls’ Day in the Physics Department.   After two years of being an online event, Girls’ Day was an in-person event this year. Various research groups were invited to prepare three-hour workshops for girls in grades 5 through 10. We were able to offer sixteen workshops and received 134 registrations. Preparing for such a large event required reserving enough classrooms (not a trivial task in semester time), buying workshop material and presents, and answering countless emails. We had two student helpers, Lisa and Carlos. A couple of days before, we prepared the goody bags for each participant with a name tag, participation certificate, and souvenirs. We even had to rent a transporter to move everything from our institute in Philosophenweg to the main campus, where the event took place.   On the event day, April 27th, 2023, Carlos, Lisa, Tina, and I showed up bright and early to prepare the registration, which was the most stressful part of the event. Once we started the welcome session to the lecture room full of curious girls, everything followed smoothly. After a short introduction and explanation of the day’s program, students were divided into different workshops. My task was to accompany our professional photographer, <a href="https://www.susanne-lencinas.de/">Susanne Lencinas</a>, to the workshops. With a dozen workshops spread over three buildings, we did our best to run around and capture the most exciting moments. The girls were involved in many exciting activities: building a black hole, a cloud chamber, a brain, or a robot, deciphering light spectra, or measuring the sugar content of a lemonade. After three intense hours, the girls headed to the student mensa. After lunch, we gathered again in a Meet&amp;Greet session where representatives from different research groups were trying to attract the girls to their stands with their interactive presentations. The day was a huge success; the girls went home extremely happy and excited.</p> <p>I was thrilled to be involved in such an exciting and meaningful event. I gained valuable experience and plan to shoulder more of the organizational tasks next year. I have often heard my male colleagues complain that it is challenging to write diversity statements.

The transition has been smooth, and I feel almost completely settled in. I have successfully filled PhD and postdoc positions in my group. My office is now furnished, and I have made it cozy with various decorations. The only outstanding issue is finding permanent accommodation, but anyone who tried searching in Heidelberg can attest it is not an easy task. :)</p> <p>One of the privileges of Emmy Noether’s position is being able to supervise PhD students. I am delighted that my PhD student <a href="/people">Fabian</a> got off to a good start. He produced exciting results with QCD kinetic theory code in the first couple of months. He will present our work at his first major conference—<a href="https://wwuindico.uni-muenster.de/event/1409/">Hard Probes</a>–in March. On the one hand, I am anxious about being the <em>senior</em> person on the paper because it is up to me to guarantee the quality of this work. On the other hand, I genuinely enjoy sharing my experience and knowledge with younger colleagues.</p> <p>In addition, I had to fill a postdoc position in my group. This task turned out to be more challenging than I expected. On the positive side, I was overwhelmed by the number of excellent postdoc candidates applying with me. However, this presented me with the impossible problem of finding a unique ordering among several brilliant people with multi-dimensional experience and skills. The applicants are often faced with a similar situation of choosing the optimal career path. In the end,  I am thrilled with the outcome of the search. <a href="/people"><strong>Adam Takacs</strong></a>, currently a PhD student at <a href="https://thermaljets.w.uib.no/team/">Konrad Tywoniuk’s group</a> in Bergen, will join my group at the end of the summer.</p> <p>The first few months at Heidelberg have been hectic. In addition to setting up my group, I co-organized the second edition of the <a href="https://indico.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/event/504/">Quantum Systems in Extreme Conditions</a> conference. The QSEC brought experts from distant fields (from cold atoms to highly charged ions to heavy-ion collisions) to discuss the common universal phenomena in isolated quantum systems. These questions are at the core of the Collaborative Research Centre <a href="https://www.isoquant-heidelberg.de">ISOQUANT</a>. I am pleased to join ISOQUANT again, this time, as one of the Principal Investigators. I had a busy travel schedule with two trips to Paris, two trips to CERN and my first visit to Santiago de Compostela. This year is no different with a busy schedule of paper and proposal writing and travels planned nearly every month. On top of that, I will give lectures for the first time at <a href="https://www.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/graddays/20231">Heidelberg Graduate Physics Student Days</a>!</p> <p>I lived in Heidelberg before, so it was easy to fall back into the routine. However, I want to discover new things during my second stay here. First, I found a lovely pottery studio in the middle of the old town, where I can enjoy Saturday mornings at the throwing wheel. After a few years of watching chess online, I finally picked up the courage to visit the local chess club. One noticeable change in Germany since my last stay is the booming vegan market. I got intrigued and have been trying out vegan recipes!</p> <p>In summary, I am happy to be back at Heidelberg and look forward to future adventures. :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="emmy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been nearly four months since my start at Heidelberg as an Emmy Noether Group leader.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">There and back again</title><link href="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/there-and-back-again/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="There and back again"/><published>2022-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/there-and-back-again</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/there-and-back-again/"><![CDATA[<p>On May 5 2022, I received the official confirmation that my grant proposal for a junior research group within the <a href="https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/emmy_noether/index.html"><strong>Emmy Noether Programme</strong></a> is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). This meant that after the postdoctoral fellowship at CERN, I can start my independent research group in Germany.</p> <p>It is hard to overstate the importance of receiving the Emmy Noether grant to me. This is the first time I was able to acquire significant third-party funding. It also means that for the first time, I will be able to formally supervise students and lead a research group. These qualities are highly sought in hiring comities and therefore give me a glimmer of hope that one day I might land a permanent job in academia. Last, but not least, receiving a positive evaluation of my work and research proposal has boosted my self-confidence to continue <strong>my pursuit as a theoretical physicist</strong>.</p> <p>As joyous as it is to receive such prestigious recognition, trying to get <strong>it nearly ended my physics career</strong>. More than a year ago I was finishing my second year as a CERN fellow and anxiously waiting for the autumn when I would need to apply for my next position. As it was supposed to be my third position after the PhD, there was mounting pressure to look for a longer-term or permanent position. Emmy Noether’s program targets young researchers with up to four years of experience after the PhD, so it was natural for me to apply.</p> <p>It is incredibly challenging to plan what you (and your group members!) will do for the next six years. It gets even worse when any idea you have seems unoriginal and any goal unachievable. The <strong>impostor syndrome</strong> festers on such thoughts. So I spent my last summer’s vacation back home in Lithuania despairing about my future and at the same time forcing myself to work on my research proposal as the submission deadline loomed.</p> <p>Eventually, I reached a point where I just could not write a single sentence. Although I received useful feedback and I knew that the text could still be improved, I just could not bear to look at it and submitted my application as it was. As a close friend pointed out, it is not worth improving my research proposal <strong>if it makes me quit physics</strong>. Although I was done with this one task, I received no relief. I had no hope of receiving the grant or any other permanent position.</p> <p>I always felt depressed during application season, but last year was particularly bad. My productivity, self-confidence, and self-worth were at an all-time low. I am very fortunate to have a very supportive family and a close circle of friends. But even that was not enough, and I reached out for professional help. With all our efforts combined, I managed to persevere until the end of the year, when things started to improve. I received some good offers and my future outlook improved. Then out of the blue, in February I was invited for an interview by the Emmy Noether committee. Being invited for an interview itself was a great achievement. I <strong>received a positive evaluation</strong>, which all but guaranteed my grant funding.</p> <p>In a relatively short period, I switched from planning how I would quit physics to composing my own Emmy Noether research group. For some, this outcome might be not surprising and my lamentation may seem hypocritical. It is not lost on me that I am a privileged man bemoaning how difficult it was for me to receive even more privilege. My struggles are nothing compared to the challenges Emmy Noether had to face to fulfill her dream. Nevertheless, my suffering was genuine and I hope it will give comfort to somebody to know that <strong>everybody is gnawed by the same doubts and insecurities</strong>, irrespective of their outward success.</p> <p>A few months ago I received the reviewer’s comments. In jarring contrast to my personal feelings, the reviewers praised my proposal as the best they have seen in years. Although I still find it hard to believe, I am now much more motivated (and a bit more confident) to give my best in achieving the goals I set out. I will start <strong>my group at the Institute for Theoretical Physics</strong> (ITP) at Heidelberg University. I have already worked and lived in Heidelberg and it is my pleasure to return to the place where I always felt so welcome. Besides the exciting science, I also have some new responsibilities to look forward to. I will have my first official PhD student — <a href="/people"><strong>Fabian Zhou</strong></a>. Fabian became familiar with some of my work while preparing his master’s thesis at ITP and I am very happy he wants to continue this line of research. In addition, I am looking for <a href="/emmy/open"><strong>a new member</strong></a> to join my group next year.</p> <p>In summary, I look forward to the next stage of my life and career. I hope that the painful experience I had will help me remain stoic in the face of any future challenges. Perhaps to thank for my good fortune, I should light up a candle at <a href="#top">Emmy Noether’s shrine</a> which (coincidently?!) is already set up at the ITP. :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="emmy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 5 2022, I received the official confirmation that my grant proposal for a junior research group within the **Emmy Noether Programme** is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">End of the fellowship</title><link href="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/end-of-the-fellowship/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="End of the fellowship"/><published>2022-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/end-of-the-fellowship</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/end-of-the-fellowship/"><![CDATA[<p>After three exciting years, my tenure as a CERN fellow has come to an end. Since 2019 I had the privilege to work at CERN Theoretical Physics department. This was clearly an amazing opportunity both professionally and personally.</p> <p>As a scientist, I was greatly motivated by working in the largest particle laboratory in the world. I was able to learn from my colleagues new techniques and broadened my expertise into new areas. For example, in my application, I wrote that I plan to learn about high-momentum physics in heavy-ion collisions. Up to then, I worked mostly on low-momentum thermalization and hydrodynamics. I am very proud of myself, that I indeed started working on new topics related to energy loss and jet physics. I learned how to do perturbative QCD calculations, calculate PDF uncertainties, and even wrote a paper on estimating missing higher-order terms.</p> <p>I have also enjoyed my social life while at CERN. I quickly became close friends with a number of my colleagues. Their friendship was very important during the long covid winter. I cherish the time spent together cooking, walking in the vineyards, and, of course, hiking in the Alps.  I grew up in a country with no mountains, so I am always astonished by the views I was witnessing during our numerous hikes. Mountains come with their own dangers and here again I was blessed to have loyal friends, who helped me in times of trouble.</p> <p>Although my time at CERN was overall enjoyable, it is not to say that there were no difficult moments. The prestige of CERN fellowship puts a heavy mental toll on trying to live up to your own expectations. It also puts a high bar for the next career step. This caused me enormous stress and despair.  Thanks again to my friends and colleagues, I was able to persevere.</p> <p>Although my CERN fellowship has come to the end, I sincerely hope that my friendships will be long lasting. I, for certain, will try to come back to CERN as often as I can.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="CERN"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After three exciting years, my tenure as a CERN fellow has come to the end.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Second Lithuanian Particle Physics Meeting</title><link href="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/second-lithuanian-particle-physics-meeting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Second Lithuanian Particle Physics Meeting"/><published>2022-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/second-lithuanian-particle-physics-meeting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/second-lithuanian-particle-physics-meeting/"><![CDATA[<p>On the 11th of April, 2022 around 30 Lithuanian scientists with interest in particle physics gathered virtually for the second time in <a href="http://cern.ch/LPPM2022">Lithuanian Particle Physics Meeting</a> (LPPM2022). The meeting had also a large number of invited guests from Lithuanian universities and government institutions.</p> <p>The meeting started with a round of short introductions. As many of the participants gave talks last year, the introductions allowed us to refresh each other’s memories and advertise any future plans. Next, we had the pleasure of listening to the presentation by Mario Pimenta from Portugal. Mario is the director of LIP — Portuguese particle laboratory and he gave a short account of how LIP and the particle physics community was created in Portugal, nearly 40 years ago. Portugal’s experience is relevant to Lithuania, where particle physics was almost nearly non-existent before Lithuania joined CERN in 2018.</p> <p>After the guest’s presentation, we started the discussion of particle physics in Lithuania. It was particularly welcoming that representatives from Foreign and Education Ministries, Vilnius, and Kaunas Universities attended LPPM2022 and contributed to the discussion. Participants were able to raise their concerns directly to the people responsible for shaping the particle physics initiatives in Lithuania. LPPM2022 also hosted three scientists from Lithuania, who have returned from abroad. Their experience returning to the homeland is very relevant to many of the meeting attendants. Finally, we discussed how to make particle physics more accessible to students in Lithuania and decided to create a dedicated Discord server.</p> <p>I was very happy that our meeting and community gained a certain level of visibility. Hopefully, this will result in stronger support for particle physics needs in Lithuania.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="LPPM"/><category term="outreach"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the 11th of April, 2022 around 30 Lithuanian scientists with interest in particle physics gathered virtually for the second time in Lithuanian Particle Physics Meeting]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Quark Matter conference in Krakow</title><link href="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/quark-matter-conference-in-krakow/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quark Matter conference in Krakow"/><published>2022-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/quark-matter-conference-in-krakow</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amazeliauskas.github.io/blog/2022/quark-matter-conference-in-krakow/"><![CDATA[<p>From the 4th to the 10th of April, 2022 the <a href="https://qm2021.syskonf.pl/">XXIX Quark Matter</a> conference took place in Krakow, Poland. It was the first major conference for me and many of my colleagues after the 2019 Quark Matter conference in the fateful Wuhan, China. Although it looked like the world was emerging from the pandemic restrictions, many people were prevented from attending the conference due to the Russian invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Scientists with Russian affiliations were expelled from participating at the conference, while some Western physicists were concerned about going to Poland, which is hosting a large number of Ukrainian refugees.</p> <p>Because I am Lithuanian Krakow for me is a very special city. As the ancient capital of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, Krakow has many connections with Lithuanian history. It is always been a pleasure for me to visit this beautiful city. I made sure to come a couple of days in advance to do more sightseeing. Despite the looming war, I found the city unchanged, with the same majestic town square, gorgeous churches, and throngs of tourists. The only notable change was the displayed messages of support for Ukraine.</p> <p>I missed attending the in-person conference. Nowhere else, you can grab 2-3 physicists from different institutions and have a quick spontaneous discussion. Also, seeing hundreds of other heavy-ion physicists bring a sense of community, which is crucial for moving forward as a field. There were many exciting talks and I was proud to present my own work or see it presented by my co-authors. I was especially thrilled to see my friend and colleague Sören Schlichting being awarded <a href="https://wigner.hu/en/zimanyi-medal">Zimányi medal</a> for</p> <blockquote> <p><em>For his groundbreaking work on turbulence in Yang-Mill fluids and its implications for thermalization in heavy ion collisions, and his important contribution to matching the nonequilibrium initial stage of heavy ion collisions to hydrodynamics with QCD kinetic theory</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, there were also some unpleasant incidents at the conference. A great many of the conference participants became infected with COVID during or after the conference. After two years of successfully avoiding the illness, I also tested positive a couple of days after the conference. Thanks to vaccines, the symptoms were mild and I have since fully recovered. In another sort of incident, one conference participant was expelled from the conference for breaking the code of conduct. Bad as such things are, I can only hope that after this our immunity to both COVID and improper behaviour will only grow stronger.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="emmy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the 4th to 10th of April, 2022 the XXIX Quark Matter conference took place in Krakow, Poland.]]></summary></entry></feed>
