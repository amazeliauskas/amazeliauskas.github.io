The high-energy heavy ion collisions (illustrated above) produce matter far from equilibrium. It is
astounding that within yoctoseconds, the QCD matter can be successfully described by fluid dynamics.
The leading explanation of such rapid QCD thermalisation is the attractor phenomena . It can be
shown that far-from-equilbrium quantum systems rapidly approach a simple trajectory in phase-space
(attractor) that does not depend on the details of initial conditions. Such attractor behaviour is universal
and can be found in systems ranging from non-relativistic scalar theories to strongly-correlated QFTs
described by gauge/gravity duality {% cite Berges:2020fwq %}.


A system near a non-thermal attractor exhibit a self-similar behaviour. For example, the time evolution
of particle distribution at early stages of heavy-ion collisions can be described by rescaling the initial
conditions with a few scaling exponents (left subplot above). I have generalised the scaling behaviour to
time-dependent scaling exponentsâ€”pre-scaling {% cite Mazeliauskas:2018yef %}. We have also made analytical prediction
for pre-scaling that has been confirmed in a cold-atom experiment {% cite Heller:2023mah %}. At later stages of heavy-
ion collision the system approaches equilibrium and exhibits hydrodynamic behaviour much earlier than
naive estimates would suggest (right subplot above). Such behaviour is called a hydrodynamic attractor.
I have extensively studied hydrodynamic attractors in QCD kinetic theory and their phenomenological
implications in heavy-ion collisions {% cite Giacalone:2019ldn Berges:2020fwq %}. I am also researching hydrodynamic attractor behaviour in
cold-atom systems.
