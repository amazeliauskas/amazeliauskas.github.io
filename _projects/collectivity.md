Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that at sufficiently high temperature and density, nuclear matter melts into fun-
damental constituent particles and forms a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The important discovery that came from the
experiments at RHIC and LHC was that the QGP created in large collision systems of gold or
lead ions can be surprisingly well described by viscous hydrodynamics. The emergence of macroscopic fluid-like behaviour over distances much smaller than a single atom is
a fascinating manifestation of the many-body physics of QCD in high-energy heavy-ion collisions {% cite Berges:2020fwq %}.

The key experimental evidence which supports the existence of such a QGP fluid is the observed long-range multi-particle correlations or collective flows (see figure above).
The pressure gradients in the QGP droplet accelerate the fluid, which creates correlations between the produced particle momentum. Because the collision produces a deformed QGP matter,
this is then converted to momentum anisotropies in the final state. Remarkably, there is a growing body of evidence
that such flow collective phenomena associated with QGP formation in heavy-ion collisions are universal and are found in all hadronic collisions, including proton-proton and proton-lead collisions, i.e., the so-called small systems. The key challenge in the field is to understand how different many-body phenomena depend on the system
size and energy scale (see figure above). 

I have taken a leading role in advancing state-of-the-art computations of nonequilibrium QCD using QCD effective kinetic theory (EKT).
Together with collaborators, I identified and calculated the hydrodynamic, chemical, and thermal equilibration time scales of the QGP in large collision systems without transverse expansion {% cite Kurkela:2018oqw Kurkela:2018xxd %}. We developed practical tools to simulate the nonequilibrium evolution of the energy-momentum tensor, enabling detailed descriptions of heavy-ion collisions from the initial collision to the later hydrodynamic stages {% cite Keegan:2016cpi Kurkela:2018vqr Kurkela:2018wud %}. We discovered a novel far-from-equilibrium phenomenon involving time-dependent self-similar evolution of particle distribution functions and devised a method to calculate entropy production during the equilibration process in heavy-ion collisions {% cite Mazeliauskas:2018yef Giacalone:2019ldn %}. Building on this work, our group is extending EKT studies, traditionally focused on large systems, to explore the emergence of collective behavior in small, transversely expanding collision systems {% cite Kurkela:2021ctp %}.
