In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) significantly alters the behavior of quarks and gluons. Using the Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigné-Schiff and Zakharov (BDMPS-Z) formalism, we explored how the QGP modifies gluon splitting into quark-antiquark pairs, with a focus on charm quarks.
Our study introduces a compact framework to account for repeated interactions between the splitting particles and the medium {% cite Attems:2022ubu Attems:2022otp %}. Two key effects emerge:

- Momentum Broadening – The quark-antiquark pairs gain relative momentum from the medium, increasing their invariant mass.

- Enhanced Production – The medium boosts the production of such pairs, especially when the momentum transfer is comparable to the quark mass.

These effects are particularly significant for charm quarks in heavy-ion collisions, as seen in ccbar production. Interestingly, the same QCD formalism that explains jet suppression also predicts enhanced production of cbar pairs in jets, a phenomenon measurable through D⁰-tagged jets. This work highlights how the QGP modifies fundamental processes in QCD, offering a new avenue for probing the medium’s properties.
