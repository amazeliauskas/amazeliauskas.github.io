The current hydrodynamical models of heavy-ion collisions use equation of state for the pressure
and energy relation, which assumes the thermodynamic equilibrium between the three light
flavour quarks and gluons with the same temperature. However such chemical equilibrium in
the quark-gluon plasma created in nuclear collisions is by no means guaranteed. This is because
in the high-energy limit the energy deposition in the central region of the collision is dominated
by gluonic fields with almost no quarks present initially and which have to be produced later.
On the other hand, the observed yields of produced hadrons (including strange hadrons) are well
described by a chemical equilibrium temperature of $T_{\\mathrm{chem}} â‰ˆ 156\\, \\mathrm{MeV}/k_B$ in the largest nucleus-nucleus collisions[^1]. This is suggestive that chemical equilibrium is reached in the quark-gluon
plasma at least in the largest collision systems.


I have [recently performed](/publication/kurkela-2018-oqw) the first leading order (in coupling constant) QCD kinetic theory
simulations with both gluon and quark degrees of freedom. We determined the relative ordering
of important equilibration time-scales between the emergence of fluid-like behaviour, quark
and gluon chemical equilibration, and the approach to thermal Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac
equilibrium (see Figure). In the accompanying [Letter](/publication/kurkela-2018-xxd) we demonstrated that the observed hadron chemical
equilibrium for large number of produced charged particles is indeed consistent with kinetic
theory results of chemically equilibrating quark-gluon plasma.

<!--The dynamical simulations of quark degrees of freedom are important for many non-equilibrium
QCD phenomena. For example, photon emission is a direct probe of charge content of the
plasma and in our recent proof-of-principle calculation we studied experimental signals of non-
equilibrium photon production. Event by event fluctuations of QCD conserved charges might also leave the imprint on the observed experimental signals 8 . I plan to explore this interesting
dynamics using fully dynamical kinetic theory framework in the future.-->
