Perhaps the greatest challenge to the consistent understanding of QCD matter formation is the disappearance of the observable energy loss of high momentum hadrons in small collisions systems. As the number of participant nucleons in peripheral lead-lead collisions reduces to order 10, the hadronic and
jet nuclear modification factors approach unity. The large systematic uncertainties are preventing an
accurate determination of energy loss in centrality selected collisions. However inclusive oxygen-oxygen
(OO) collisions planned in the run 3 of LHC are free from such systematic uncertainties. 

Together with my
colleagues at CERN, I quantified and predicted the expected energy
loss signal in OO collisions {% cite Huss:2020dwe Huss:2020whe %}. We employed state-of-the-art perturbative QCD calculations of jet and
Z-production cross sections with nuclear parton distribution functions to determine a precise
theoretical baseline in the absence of medium induced modification. Combined with a number of
energy loss models in small systems, we were able to conclude that OO collisions have sufficient sensitivity to discover energy loss in a system
of about 10 colliding nucleons. 

To explore the physics opportunities of physics opportunities of OO and pO collisions at the LHC I organised a dedicated workshop in 2021 (see poster above) {% cite Brewer:2021kiv %}. One of the experimental
limitations of a short oxygen run at the LHC, is the lack of corresponding pp reference at the same collision energies. With colleagues we explored different methods
of interpolating jet and hadron spectra from neighboring energies {% cite Brewer:2021tyv %}. We also proposed considering ratios of spectra at different collision energies.
With my group, I continue different observables of energy loss in small collision systems. In particular, we computed the no-quenching baseline for
semi-inclusive hadron- and jet- triggered nuclear modification factors {% cite Gebhard:2024flv %}.
