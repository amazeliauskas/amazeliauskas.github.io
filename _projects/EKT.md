At weak coupling and high temperatures, a successful ﬁrst principle
dynamical description of the QGP medium is given by QCD eﬀective kinetic theory (EKT). The leading
order elastic scatterings and medium induced colinear radiation contain the essential microscopic
physics necessary to describe the equilibration of non-abelian plasma—the so called “bottom up” thermalization scenario (see figure above). Therefore EKT links the early time particle production by strong color ﬁelds in
the colliding nuclei to the late time hydrodynamic evolution of QGP ﬂuid {% cite Berges:2020fwq %}. Detailed numerical simulations of
EKT provided quantitative understanding of the hydrodynamization, pre-scaling and chemical equilibration phenomena in heavy ion collisions {% cite Keegan:2016cpi Kurkela:2018vqr Kurkela:2018wud Kurkela:2018oqw Kurkela:2018xxd  Mazeliauskas:2018yef Giacalone:2019ldn  Mazeliauskas:2018yef  Heller:2023mah %}.
While so far EKT studies have been limited to large systems, it is perfectly suited to study the system size dependence of collective effects.
Therefore, my group is extending EKT computations to study the
jet quenching and collective flow phenomena at different system sizes {% cite Kurkela:2021ctp  Zhou:2024ysb %}. Our goal is to predict the rich set
of kinematic, chemical, and electromagnetic signals of
collective phenomena observed at the LHC.
