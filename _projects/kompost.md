Extracting the QGP medium properties, like shear or bulk viscosities, is the primary goal of
heavy-ion research. However choice of initial conditions for the hydrodynamical evolution of
the plasma is the main source of model uncertainties. Therefore the first principle modelling of
initial gauge fields, or multi-parameter model-to-data fits have been very important for the
progress of the field. However, until recently none of the approaches included the pre-equilibrium
physics, which would naturally lead to hydrodynamical expansion of QGP.

In a series of works {% cite Keegan:2016cpi Kurkela:2018vqr Kurkela:2018wud  %}, we have constructed a linearized response framework based on
kinetic theory simulations, which propagates initial non-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor
to the time, when the hydrodynamic constitutive equations are satisfied. Our publicly available
package [KøMPøST](https://github.com/KMPST/KoMPoST) is a practical tool to do event-by-event simulations of heavy-ion collisions
with realistic pre-equilibrium dynamics.
